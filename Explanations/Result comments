I have compared only the 10 firsts seconds because the transformation between codecs was so slowly and hard. In this time we can not notice a huge change in quality on the videos,
they seem equally fluid with each other. The results that we have obtained are very similar.

In this part of the video we can observe the movement of the water and a movement of a bird. The main difference that I have found is that one of the videos change between the scenes at different time than the others. One of the scenes this video was advanced and in other change it was more slow. I have attached a capture of the situation in the same folder.
